[Catheryne Nicholson, CEO of BlockCypher, introduced Ignotus to speak. Then, she
asked the audience to put on T-shirts reading “I AM IGNOTUS” and showing the yellow
Grin logo.]

Nice outfit.
[laughter]
[pause]

[robotic feminine voice]
Catheryne, can you give me a sign that the audio is working?
[pause]

[robotic masculine voice]
Hello, everyone. I see this is a full room. Welcome to the first U.S. Grincon everyone. My name
is Ignotus Peverell and I started Grin about two and a half years ago. 
[pause]

[robotic feminine voice]

This is only the second time I do this, and I hope you can forgive me for not being here in the
flesh. It does still feel a little weird. But, I value my privacy and obviously this directly applies to
Grin. I’m certainly going to have to upgrade my robotic style at some point. I have to thank
Catheryne and BlockCypher for doing all the organization for this event and fronting all the
costs. BlockCypher has been a great Grin steward. When looking at the caliber and the diversity
in the speaker lineup, as well as breadth of the topics you will be exposed to today, I&#39;m in awe.
Compliments to Catheryne and her team, and congratulations for GrinMint. Give Quentin a pat
on the back for me.

When I started Grin, I would never have thought that less than three years later, Grin would be
launched and such a high-quality event would be possible. I&#39;m pretty sure kanzure and Andrew
didn&#39;t either when they were the first to look at the codedump on GitHub. And, I’m pretty sure
that when John, Michael, and Antioch joined afterward, they didn&#39;t really think so either. But,
here they are today, and you&#39;ll hear many of the people who participated and built Grin, as well
as foremost cryptography and privacy researchers. I&#39;m very excited.

[robotic feminine voice]
Given that this event is taking place in Silicon Valley, everyone is going to be asking about use
cases.
[pause]

[robotic masculine voice]
Obviously, the long-term vision is for us, your robot overlords, to take over and exterminate
humans.
[laughter]

[robotic feminine voice]
But, as humans are already good at this, no magic blockchain is necessary.

[robotic masculine voice]
No, the real goal for Grin is to be better cash. We all have a bit of a Stockholm syndrome with
the current financial system, but, money right now sucks. Privacy is getting eroded in every
possible way with massive internet companies aggregating data; they already have with block
payment data. Authoritarian overreach is absolutely possible, and it&#39;s a scary thought. It has
happened over and over throughout the centuries. It’d be naive to think we&#39;re now somehow
immune. Access to finance sucks, as just institutionalizing money is extremely expensive. Cash
is becoming increasingly obsoleted, both by our modern lifestyle, and capital control
enforcement. You don&#39;t even get to control the value of your money or get to know its future

value. Really, if you step back for a minute, our current incarnation of money sucks. And so I
think we really have a good shot at making better money. It&#39;s obviously a massive undertaking,
but, Grin has a huge qualities. 
First, just like Bitcoin, Grin is free for all to take and use. It&#39;s open source, and open source has
already changed the world in many ways. Anyone with a will can get involved. It&#39;s not controlled
by any single entity, and you&#39;ll see a very diverse set of direct and indirect contributors today. 
Second, it’s fairly private, fungible, and censorship-resistant. I say “fairly” because we definitely
have to keep pushing in that direction, but we have a really good start already. 
Third, we&#39;re building not for today or tomorrow, but for ten or twenty years away. Grin is nimble
and already very scalable, with many improvements to come and should be an excellent base for
layer two solutions. 
And finally, Grin has that outstanding community. It&#39;s always easy to sink into cynicism when
you’re exposed to constant criticism from the peanut gallery. It’s easy to consider others
unworthy of our expert opinion. But, that&#39;s not the Grin way. There’s an amazing amount of
power in being nice and welcoming, open and helpful, and excessively polite. 

[robotic feminine voice]
Before I finish abusing this monotone voice, how do you like your T-shirts? When Catheryne
asked about the design, I was tempted to ask her to change it. What&#39;s up with my name on top of
Pac-Man? But, now I see it as a token to show that anyone, and especially you, can come and
participate in Grin, just like I and others do every day. As I already said, Grin is first and
foremost open source. Anyone can contribute with their unique set of talent. And like any open
source project, we’re resource-constrained. So, if you&#39;re a designer, developer, project manager,
technical doc writer, UX expert, community manager, or you think you can do any of those
things decently well, come join us. Find someone in the room who is contributing to Grin and
ask them how they started. You will at least get a few good stories.

[robotic masculine voice, British accent]
And, if all you can contribute is money, that&#39;s okay too. We can take it. Links to donation
campaigns will be shown multiple times today. I think you’ll agree that the amounts are very
reasonable compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been used by other projects.
And, I think you&#39;ll agree, too, that we’re using money and resources very judiciously, with
matching goals that have all been reached so far. I know it really helps when you can put a
robotic voice in front of no present face.

[robotic masculine voice]
Thank you everyone for your patience, and make the most of today.

[applause]
